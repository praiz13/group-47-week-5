## Overview

This repository explores the end-to-end AI development workflow for two data-driven challenges:
- Predicting student dropout rates in a university setting.
- Predicting patient readmission within 30 days of hospital discharge.

The project details the steps from data collection to model deployment, with a focus on practical solutions, stakeholder impact, and ethical considerations.

## Part 1: Student Dropout Prediction Workflow

### Problem Definition

- **Objective:**  
  - Flag at-risk students at least one semester early.
  - Provide advisors with a ranked list of risk factors per student.
  - Reduce overall dropout rate by ≥10% within two academic years.

- **Stakeholders:**  
  Academic advisors, retention office, students, and parents.

- **Key Performance Indicator (KPI):**  
  Percentage reduction in semester-to-semester dropout rate among flagged students.

### Data Collection & Preprocessing

- **Data Sources:**  
  - University Learning Management System (attendance, assignment submissions)
  - Student Information System (demographics, GPA, financial aid status)

- **Potential Bias:**  
  Under-representation of non-traditional or part-time students could skew predictions.

- **Preprocessing Steps:**  
  1. Impute missing GPA values using the semester-level median.
  2. Normalize continuous features (e.g., GPA, attendance %).
  3. One-hot encode categorical variables (major, housing status).

### Model Development

- **Model Choice:**  
  Gradient Boosting Trees (e.g., XGBoost)

- **Justification:**  
  Handles mixed data types, captures non-linear interactions, and provides feature importance scores.

- **Data Splitting Strategy:**  
  70% training, 15% validation, 15% test (stratified by dropout label).

- **Hyperparameters to Tune:**  
  - `max_depth` (model complexity)
  - `learning_rate` (convergence speed)

### Evaluation & Deployment

- **Evaluation Metrics:**  
  - Recall (identify as many at-risk students as possible)
  - AUC-ROC (balanced evaluation)

- **Concept Drift:**  
  - Monitor feature-target relationship changes (e.g., with PSI)
  - Use rolling-window validation

- **Technical Challenge & Solution:**  
  - **Scalability:** Real-time scoring during peak periods can overload systems.
  - **Solution:** Deploy the model in containers (Docker) with auto-scaling APIs (Kubernetes).

## Part 2: Patient Readmission Case Study

### Problem Scope

- **Objective:**  
  - Predict if a patient will be readmitted within 30 days.
  - Alert care-coordination team early.
  - Reduce readmissions by ≥15%.

- **Stakeholders:**  
  Hospital administrators, physicians, nurses, and patients.

### Data Strategy

- **Data Sources:**  
  - Electronic Health Records (diagnosis codes, lab results, vitals)
  - Demographics (age, gender, socioeconomic index)
  - Hospital utilization (prior admissions, length of stay)

- **Ethical Concerns:**  
  - Patient privacy & HIPAA compliance.
  - Bias against underserved minorities.

### Preprocessing Pipeline

1. De-identify PHI, tokenize IDs.
2. Impute missing labs (last-observation-carried-forward).
3. Feature engineering: Charlson Comorbidity Index, abnormal-lab count, discharge hour.

### Model Development

- **Model:**  
  Logistic Regression with L1 regularization

- **Justification:**  
  Simple, interpretable, and avoids overfitting with sparse weights.

- **Example Confusion Matrix (1000 patients):**
    |               | Predicted No | Predicted Yes |
    |---------------|-------------|--------------|
    | Actual No     | 760         | 90           |
    | Actual Yes    | 60          | 90           |

    - **Precision:** 0.50
    - **Recall:** 0.60

### Deployment

- **Integration Steps:**  
  1. Package model as REST service (FastAPI)
  2. Connect to hospital EHR via HL7/FHIR interface
  3. Trigger nightly scoring at discharge

- **Regulatory Compliance:**  
  - HIPAA risk assessment
  - Audit trails for predictions
  - Encrypt data in transit (TLS) and at rest (AES-256)

### Optimization

- **Method:**  
  k-fold cross-validation with early stopping on validation AUC

---

## Part 3: Ethics, Bias, and Trade-offs

- **Bias Mitigation:**  
  Re-weight samples or apply adversarial debiasing to equalize error rates across groups.

- **Interpretability vs. Accuracy:**  
  Clinicians prefer interpretable models (Logistic Regression) for trust and compliance, even if deep models are more accurate.

- **Resource Constraints:**  
  Simpler models (Logistic Regression, XGBoost) are favored when computational resources are limited.

---

## Part 4: Reflection

- **Most Challenging Part:**  
  Ensuring high-quality labeled data; EHR records can be inconsistent.

- **Improvement:**  
  Involve clinicians in labeling and integrate social-determinant data for a holistic view.
